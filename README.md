# 365-DS-Python-BootCamp-CapStone-Project

  This was a project I did upon completion of the Python Bootcamp by 365 Data Science. It involves Computer Vision and I used the "cv2" library to achieve this. The purpose of the project was to get a detect coins in a picture while assigining values to the coins and getting the total value of the coins. You can see the final result in the Detected Coins File.
